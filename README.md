### Who I amðŸ˜„
I'm an undergraduate from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and I initially majored in Information Engineering in the first year, but then I have changed my major to Software Engineering, in which I'm quite interested.

### Personal Character
Easygoing, outgoing but sometimes impetuous. A sheer pessimist.

### HobbiesðŸ‘¯
+ Coding (At most time, except for doing the lab Orz)

+ Animation (My favour: Mushishi, Steins;Gate)

+ Movies (My favour: Interstellar, Inception)

+ Sports (Swimming, Baseball)

+ Games (Legue of legends (Have played for 8 years), Oxygen not included, Minecraft, Don't starve together...)

#### Welcome to play with me in steam or chat with me in reality.
